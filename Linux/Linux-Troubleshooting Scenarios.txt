Linux-Troubleshooting Scenarios 

Here are some key points for troubleshooting common issues in Linux systems:

1. Server Connectivity Issues:
 - Ping the server by Hostname and IP Address: Ensure the server is reachable.
 - Check service availability with telnet command: Confirm that the required service ports are open and accessible.
 - Verify service status, firewall settings, logs, and configuration: Ensure the service is running, firewall rules are correct, and logs do not show errors.

2. Disk Space Full Issue:
 - Detect system performance degradation: Look for slowdowns that might indicate disk space issues.
 - Identify the problematic filesystem using `df` command: Use `df -h` to check disk space usage.
 - Use `du` command to find large files/directories, compress/remove them: Run `du -sh * | sort -h` to locate large directories and files.
 - Check disk health with `badblocks`, analyze IO-bound processes: Use `badblocks` to check for bad sectors and monitor I/O activity.

3. Filesystem Corruption:
 - Check log files for errors causing boot-up failure: Review logs in `/var/log` for error messages.
 - Run `fsck`, reboot into rescue mode to fix bad sectors: Use `fsck` to check and repair filesystems, boot into rescue mode if necessary.

4. Fstab File Issues:
 - Troubleshoot missing or incorrect entries in `fstab`: Ensure that the `fstab` file is correctly configured by checking for typos or missing entries.

5. Memory Issues:
 - Monitor memory usage with cache and RAM, identify high memory processes: Use `free -m` to check memory usage and `top` or `htop` to find high memory-consuming processes.
 - Address memory shortages by restarting processes, adding more RAM, or extending swap space: Restart problematic processes, consider adding physical RAM, or increase swap space.

6. Swap Space Management:
 - Add more swap space by creating a swap file, setting permissions, and updating `fstab` for persistence:
 - Create a swap file: `sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile`
 - Set correct permissions: `sudo chmod 600 /swapfile`
 - Make the file a swap space: `sudo mkswap /swapfile`
 - Enable the swap file: `sudo swapon /swapfile`
 - Update `/etc/fstab` for persistence: `echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab`

These key points provide a structured approach to efficiently tackle common Linux system issues.
