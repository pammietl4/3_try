1. INIT Container
2. Adaptor Container
3. Ambassdor Container

INIT Container -- imagine in a node, we have 3 containers in that 
1 container is Main container(application deployed) & other 
2 containers are sidecar containers (works as servant to main container)
Example -- 
if you want to deploy DB server in Main container(1) then 
sidecar conatiner1 will check the DB Endpoints are working fine or not
sidecar conatainer2 will check whether the Services is working fine or not
if everything is good then only Main container will deploy

Adapter container -- Adapter containers are mainly used in service mesh
it helps in server proxy, logging , Tracing , Metrics

Ambassador Containers -- Mainly used in Micro services
1-- SSL Terminations
2-- Routes to Path based Routing with in the K8s cluster
it has the capability of routing the traffic to the different micro service deployed in that k8s cluster.


Resource Qota & Limits
-----------------------
Resource Qota -- will be applied on Namespace level
Resource Limits -- will be applied on Container Level
Example --
if you have node with 20 CPU & 20 GB Memory
then you will create 4 namespaces (AP-Team), (GL-Team),(AR-Team),(HR-Team)
here we are sharing 20 CPU & 20 GB Memory to above Teams 
now you are assigning the resource quota to AP-Team Namepace -- 5GB CPU & 5GB Memory
now you are assigning the resource quota to GL-Team Namepace -- 8GB CPU & 7GB Memory
now you are assigning the resource quota to AP-Team Namepace -- 4GB CPU & 5GB Memory
now you are assigning the resource quota to AP-Team Namepace -- 3GB CPU & 3GB Memory
Note-- for each namespace you are assigning Resource Limits to containers -- how many containers can be create & size of the container
