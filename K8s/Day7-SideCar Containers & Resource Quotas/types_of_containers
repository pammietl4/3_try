INIT Container -- imagine in a node, we have 3 containers in that 
1 container is Main container(application deployed) & other 
2 containers are sidecar containers (works as servant to main container)
Example -- 
if you want to deploy DB server in Main container(1) then 
sidecar conatiner1 will check the DB Endpoints are working fine or not
sidecar conatainer2 will check whether the Services is working fine or not
if everything is good then only Main container will deploy

it helps in server proxy, logging , Tracing , Metrics

Ambassador Containers -- Mainly used in Micro services
1-- SSL Terminations
2-- Routes to Path based Routing with in the K8s cluster
it has the capability of routing the traffic to the different micro service deployed in that k8s cluster.
