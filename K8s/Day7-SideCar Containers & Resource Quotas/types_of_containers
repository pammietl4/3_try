1. INIT Container
2. Adaptor Container
3. Ambassdor Container

INIT Container -- imagine in a node, we have 3 containers in that 
1 container is Main container(application deployed) & other 
2 containers are sidecar containers (works as servant to main container)
Example -- 
if you want to deploy DB server in Main container(1) then 
sidecar conatiner1 will check the DB Endpoints are working fine or not
sidecar conatainer2 will check whether the Services is working fine or not
if everything is good then only Main container will deploy
