✅ DevOps Actions Now:
🔧 Step 1: Confirm the state of process 584

ps -o pid,stat,comm -p 584
Look at the STAT column:

If it shows D → it’s stuck in I/O.
If it shows Z → zombie.
If R or S → strange, because SIGKILL should’ve worked.

🔁 Step 2: Try fuser or lsof to check what it's holding

sudo lsof -p 584
This shows any file/network resource it’s stuck on.

💻 Step 3: Safest and Only Working Option – Reboot
Unfortunately, you can’t kill a D-state process — only a reboot can clear it.
sudo reboot

🧠 Before You Reboot (as a DevOps engineer):

✅ Do This:
🔒 Notify the application owner or stakeholders (e.g., developer team or support team).
📦 Take a backup of /etc/nginx/ (if you made changes recently).
📂 Backup or inspect /var/log/nginx/ (in case logs are needed later).
📝 Document this incident in your internal monitoring or ticketing system.

❗ Why this matters for DevOps:

As a DevOps engineer:
It's your job to identify root causes, not just restart services.
These I/O-hang scenarios might point to:
Failing disk,
Bad NFS mounts,
File descriptor leaks.

After reboot:
sudo systemctl status nginx

Then watch the logs:
sudo journalctl -u nginx.service -f
Let me know what ps -o pid,stat,comm -p 584 shows — we can go deeper if needed before rebooting.
