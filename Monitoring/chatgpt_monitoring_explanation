How DevOps Engineers Monitor System-Related Activities?
As a DevOps Engineer, monitoring the system is crucial for performance, security, and reliability. We use various tools and techniques to track what’s happening in our infrastructure. Let’s break it down using Flipkart’s backend as an example.

1️⃣ Monitoring System Performance (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network)
Imagine Flipkart’s servers are like delivery trucks. If they are overloaded, orders get delayed. We monitor:
✔ CPU Usage – If a server is overloaded, it needs autoscaling.
✔ Memory Usage – Ensures applications don’t crash due to out-of-memory (OOM) issues.
✔ Disk Usage – Prevents storage from running out (causing order failures).
✔ Network Traffic – Detects slowdowns or attacks.

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
top      # View CPU & memory usage  
df -h    # Check disk usage  
iostat   # Monitor I/O performance  
netstat -tulnp  # See open ports and network connections  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

Prometheus & Grafana (for real-time metrics visualization 📊)

CloudWatch (AWS) (for cloud-based monitoring 🚀)

Nagios, Zabbix (for on-premise servers 🏢)

🔹 Interview Question: How do you monitor system performance in Linux?

2️⃣ Monitoring Logs (System & Application Logs)
Logs are like CCTV footage of Flipkart’s backend. We track:
✔ System Logs – Check if a server rebooted unexpectedly.
✔ Application Logs – Find errors in Flipkart’s order processing system.
✔ Security Logs – Detect unauthorized access.

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
journalctl -f    # View live system logs  
tail -f /var/log/syslog  # Live application logs  
grep "ERROR" /var/log/app.log  # Find specific errors  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – Log analysis & visualization

CloudWatch Logs (AWS) – Centralized log management

Splunk, Graylog – Advanced log monitoring

🔹 Interview Question: How do you set up centralized logging for a microservices-based architecture?

3️⃣ User Activity & Security Monitoring (Who Accessed What?)
Security is a major concern in Flipkart’s infrastructure. We track:
✔ Who logged in? (Detect unauthorized SSH access)
✔ Who changed system files? (Find suspicious modifications)
✔ Failed login attempts? (Prevent brute-force attacks)

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
last -a   # Check user login history  
who       # See who is logged in now  
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed password"  # Check failed logins  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

AWS GuardDuty – Detects unusual login patterns

OSSEC, Wazuh – Open-source intrusion detection systems

SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) – Enterprise-level security monitoring

🔹 Interview Question: How do you monitor SSH login activity in a Linux server?

4️⃣ Service & Process Monitoring (Detect Application Failures)
In Flipkart’s backend, services like payment processing, order confirmation, and inventory tracking must always run. If a process crashes, we must restart it automatically.

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl status nginx   # Check if Nginx is running  
ps aux | grep java       # Find Java-based processes  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

Monit & Supervisor – Restart failed processes automatically

Prometheus & Alertmanager – Sends alerts when a service is down

AWS CloudWatch Alarms – Notifies if an EC2 instance is unhealthy

🔹 Interview Question: How do you automatically restart a failed process in Linux?

5️⃣ Network & Traffic Monitoring (Slow Performance & Attacks)
Imagine Flipkart’s servers like a toll plaza. If too many cars (requests) arrive, traffic jams (slowdowns) happen. We monitor:
✔ How many users are connected?
✔ Is the network bandwidth sufficient?
✔ Are there DDoS attacks?

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
netstat -tulnp   # Show open ports & connections  
iftop            # Monitor real-time network usage  
tcpdump -i eth0  # Capture network packets  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

AWS VPC Flow Logs – Track all network traffic

Wireshark, Tcpdump – Analyze packet-level traffic

Cloudflare, AWS Shield – Protect against DDoS attacks

🔹 Interview Question: How do you detect and prevent DDoS attacks in AWS?

6️⃣ Disk & Storage Monitoring (Prevent Out-of-Space Issues)
If Flipkart’s database runs out of space, orders fail! We track:
✔ How much disk space is left?
✔ Which files are using too much storage?
✔ Are old logs getting deleted?

How to monitor?
✅ Linux Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -h        # Check free disk space  
du -sh *     # Find large files  
journalctl --vacuum-time=2d  # Delete logs older than 2 days  
✅ Monitoring Tools:

AWS CloudWatch Metrics – Monitor EBS disk usage

Zabbix, Nagios – Disk monitoring for on-premise servers

🔹 Interview Question: How do you prevent disk space from filling up in production servers?

7️⃣ Automated Alerting & Incident Response (Get Notified!)
A DevOps engineer doesn’t manually check logs every hour. Instead, we set up automatic alerts when something goes wrong.

How to set up alerts?
✅ Monitoring Tools:

AWS CloudWatch Alarms – Sends alerts if CPU usage is too high

Grafana Alerts – Triggers a Slack notification if an app crashes

PagerDuty, OpsGenie – Notifies on-call engineers of incidents

🔹 Interview Question: How do you set up alerts for high CPU utilization in AWS?
